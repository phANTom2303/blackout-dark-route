## Isolating event folder
4. Click on the settings icon > profile > Profiles . Then click on `New Profile`
5. Create a new Profile with the name `blackout-challenge`. Under the `Contents` section of this new profile , you will see a `source` column; ensure all the sources are set to `None`.
6. Click `Create`

## Disabling copilot 
7. Navigate to the extensions tab and disable Github Copilot & Copilot Chat extensions

## Disable all extensions at once (not foolproof)
8. Press `Ctrl + shift + p`  & type `Reload with extensions disabled` and hit enter. This disables all extensions, but, if the participant closes & reopens vscode then all extensions work again.

## OC Notes : 
1. Make sure particpants are typing in `.txt` or text files. This ensures there is absolutely no syntax highlighting for keywords.
2. Open the `.txt` file where particpants are expected to type. Right click on the tab for this file on top of the screen, scroll down to the bottom, click `Copy to new window`. This will launch the file in a new window without anything visible.
3. Lastly, press `F11` on your keyboard to enter full screen.
4. Have some form of Proctoring so that participants do not break this configuration.
